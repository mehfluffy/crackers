# RSA cracker
Simple executable to crack RSA by factorisation, will take very long for large *n*.

## Todo:
* Plot out time to crack vs bitsize of *n*, for each factorize function -> choose which function to use depending on size of *n*
* Given *e* = 65537 and known *n*, is there a way to map out possible values for *d* (via a faster method than factorisation)?
